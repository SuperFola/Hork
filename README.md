# Hork

A Zork inspired game, using one of the best programming languages, HTML.

The rules for this project are simple:
* only HTML can be used for the game, thus no JavaScript nor CSS
* CSS is tricky as some argue that `<style>...</style>` is CSS, and that using the `style="..."` attribute is also using CSS ; the only exception is `style="color:#xxxxxx"`
