    <u>Living Room</u>
    <p>You are in the living room. There is a doorway to the east, a wooden door with strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be nailed shut, a trophy case, and a large oriental rug in the center of the room.</p>
    <p>Above the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.</p>
    <p>A battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.</p>
