    <u>Kitchen</u>
    <p>You are in the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have been used recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward. A dark chimney leads down and to the east is a small window which is open.</p>
    <p>On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.</p>
    <p>A bottle is sitting on the table.</p>
    <p>The glass bottle contains:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A quantity of water</li>
    </ul>
